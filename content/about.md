Welcome to my site! I've worked in data analytics within the non-profit sector for my entire career and love all things data, vizualization, and evaluation. The fact that we can use math (and other tools!) to show how the work that amazing organizations do, make a difference in peoples' lives, is frankly incredible. As a relatively new R user and [**Rstudio**] (www.Rstudio.com) lover, I will use this site to post blogs written in rmarkdown, dissect and analyze new datasets, and visualize data with tools like [Shiny] (www.shiny.rstudio.com) and ggplot2. I strongly believe that learning comes from doing, so this is my attempt to learn more about data science and data visualization by broadcasting my portfolio to the world while invariably making lots of mistakes!
